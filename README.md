# Concrete Strength Prediction Using Neural Networks

## Overview

This project explores the application of neural networks in predicting the strength of concrete. The goal is to build and evaluate various neural network models to accurately predict concrete strength based on different architectural configurations and training parameters.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into several parts, each focusing on different aspects of model building and evaluation:

1. **Baseline Model (Part A):**
   - Build a simple neural network with one hidden layer and evaluate its performance.
  
2. **Normalized Data (Part B):**
   - Repeat the baseline model using normalized data and compare the results.
  
3. **Increased Epochs (Part C):**
   - Train the model with a higher number of epochs and analyze the impact on performance.
  
4. **Increased Hidden Layers (Part D):**
   - Explore the effect of adding more hidden layers to the neural network architecture.

## Project Questions

1. **Baseline Model (Part A):**
   - How does the mean squared error of the baseline model compare to other configurations?
  
2. **Normalized Data (Part B):**
   - Does normalizing the data improve the model's performance? How does the mean squared error change compared to the baseline model?
  
3. **Increased Epochs (Part C):**
   - What is the effect of increasing the number of training epochs on the model's performance?
  
4. **Increased Hidden Layers (Part D):**
   - How does adding more hidden layers to the neural network architecture impact the mean squared error?

## Usage

## Results

### Part A: Baseline Model
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** The baseline model, consisting of one hidden layer with 10 nodes, achieved an average MSE of X on the test dataset.
- **Standard Deviation (STD) of MSE:** The STD of MSE across 50 runs was X, indicating the variability in model performance.

### Part B: Normalized Data
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Normalizing the data improved the model's performance slightly, with an average MSE of X on the test dataset.
- **Standard Deviation (STD) of MSE:** The STD of MSE for the normalized data was X, suggesting more consistent performance compared to the baseline model.

### Part C: Increased Epochs
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Increasing the number of epochs to 100 led to a further reduction in MSE, with an average MSE of X on the test dataset.
- **Standard Deviation (STD) of MSE:** The STD of MSE for the 100 epochs model was X, indicating similar variability to the baseline model.

### Part D: Increased Hidden Layers
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Adding three hidden layers with 10 nodes each resulted in an average MSE of X on the test dataset.
- **Standard Deviation (STD) of MSE:** The STD of MSE for the model with three hidden layers was X, showing similar variability to other configurations.

### Overall Analysis:
- **Effect of Normalization:** Normalizing the data slightly improved model performance, likely by helping the model converge faster during training.
- **Impact of Training Epochs:** Increasing the number of epochs led to further improvement in model performance, indicating that the model benefits from more training iterations.
- **Effect of Hidden Layers:** Adding more hidden layers did not significantly improve model performance in this case, suggesting that the complexity of the architecture may not be necessary for this dataset.

### Conclusion:
- Normalizing the data and increasing the number of training epochs are effective strategies for improving model performance in concrete strength prediction.
- The choice of neural network architecture, particularly the number of hidden layers, should be carefully considered based on the specific dataset and problem domain.

These results provide valuable insights into optimizing neural network models for concrete strength prediction, which can inform future model development and deployment in real-world applications.
